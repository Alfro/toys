# IRC Bots

CIAcutre as the name states, is a cheap clone of CIA bots, which checks an svn repository and alerts of new commits.
WoFBot just logs all the messages from the current channel.
WoFie is the original bot, with some basic commands.
multiWoFie is the updated version, with support for multiple networks, channels and a lot more commands.

Please note most WoFie commands are inside jokes, nothing really useful.
